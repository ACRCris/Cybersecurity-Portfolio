# Instructions for including SQL queries

It’s strongly recommended that you return to the [**Filter with AND, OR, and NOT**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linux-and-sql/ungradedLti/wVReS/activity-filter-with-and-or-and-not) lab to include screenshots of your SQL queries in the command-line interface. If this isn’t possible, you can also type your queries in this document. 

When including samples of SQL queries, consider the following:

* There are multiple applications that can be used to take screenshots. If you’re unsure how to take a screenshot on your device, you can perform an online search such as “how to take a screenshot in \[your operating system\].” Replace “\[your operating system\]” with the operating system your computer uses. 

* Do not include the lab instructions on the right of the screen in your screenshots. 

* For any typed queries, highlight your query in gray and use a monospaced font, such as in this example: 

  SELECT employeee\_id, device\_id

  FROM employees;
