I performed a guided decryption workflow in a Linux shell where simulated user data had been encrypted. I inspected directory contents, uncovered a hidden file containing a Caesar cipher, translated its shifted text, and then used the revealed OpenSSL command to decrypt an AES‑256‑CBC encrypted file to recover the final message.

## Objectives accomplished

- Listed visible and hidden files in a user home directory using basic Linux commands.
- Read instructional content and identified a hidden dotfile containing a Caesar cipher.
- Decrypted the Caesar cipher with `tr` by reversing a left shift of 3 characters.
- Applied the provided OpenSSL command to decrypt an AES‑256‑CBC file with PBKDF2 key strengthening.
- Validated successful recovery of plaintext by comparing file presence and contents.
