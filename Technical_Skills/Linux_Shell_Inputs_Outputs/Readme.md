# Activity Summary 

Google Cloud lab: Examine Shell Inputs and Outputs on a Linux Bash environment.

![alt text](ActivityResult.png)

In this Google Cloud activity, I practiced sending commands to a Bash shell and interpreting the resulting output and messages. The lab used simple commands (`echo`, `expr`, `clear`) to illustrate how inputs are processed and displayed, reinforcing core Linux communication skills for security analysts.

## Objectives accomplished

- Used `echo` to print strings and understand how Bash handles quoted input.
- Performed integer calculations with `expr`, observing required spacing between operators and operands.
- Cleared the terminal history with `clear` to keep the shell organized.
- Documented commands, expected outputs, and takeaways for future reference.
