In this Google Cloud activity, I used the APT package manager to install, remove, and verify security‑related tools (Suricata and tcpdump) in a Bash shell. The work demonstrates essential Linux package‑management skills for security analysts while safely operating in a Google Cloud‑hosted environment.

## Objectives accomplished

- Verified APT availability and basic usage.
- Installed and removed Suricata, confirming each step.
- Installed tcpdump and verified via the installed packages list.
- Reinstalled Suricata and confirmed both tools were present.
- Captured commands, outputs, and screenshots for repeatability.
