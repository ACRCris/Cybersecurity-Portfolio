# Questions

## What were the scope and objectives of the audit?

### Scope

Botium Toys internal IT audit will assess the following:
- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event
management (SIEM) tool.

- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) tool.

- Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting,
end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place

align with necessary compliance requirements.
- Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.

### Goals
The goals for Botium Toysâ€™ internal IT audit are:

- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF)

- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant

- Fortify system controls

- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management

- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks

- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements

## What were the critical findings of the audit that must be addressed immediately?
*_(i.e., which controls and/or policies need to be urgently implemented)._!
The controls to implement immediately are:
- **Administrative**: Least Privilege, password policies, access control polices.
- **Technical**: Intrusion detection system (IDS), firewalls, encryption, backups, antivirus software, manual monitoring; maintenance; intervention.
- **Physical**: Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, locks.

The policies to implement immediately are:
- General data protection regulation (GDPR) policy
- Payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) policy


## What were the conclusions?
*_(i.e., which controls and/or policies should be addressed in the future)._!
The controls to implement in the future are:
- **Administrative**: Disaster recovery plan, account management policies.
- **Technical**: Password management system.
- **Physical**: Time controlled safe, adequate lighting, locking cabinets, signage indicating alarm service, fire detection and prevention system.

The policies to implement in the future are:
- System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)


## How can you clearly and concisely summarize your recommendations to stakeholders?

Address to the NIST CSF framework, which is a voluntary framework that consists of five functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The NIST CSF framework is a great way to ensure that Botium Toys is compliant with the necessary regulations and standards together with help to implement the necessary controls . Furthermore implement immediately the policies for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) to avoid fines and ensure the protection of customer data.
