# Activity Summary 

Portfolio Activity: Conduct a Security Audit (Part 2) from the course "Manage Security Risks" in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

I communicated the internal audit results and recommendations for the fictitious company Botium Toys through a stakeholder memorandum. Building on the controls assessment and compliance checklist from Part 1, I summarized the audit scope and goals, highlighted critical findings to address immediately, outlined additional findings for follow‑up, and provided a clear, concise summary with actionable recommendations aligned to the NIST CSF.

## Objectives accomplished

- Reviewed the Part 1 Controls Assessment and Compliance Checklist to ground the analysis.
- Summarized audit scope and goals for a non‑technical audience of stakeholders.
- Listed critical findings (immediate action) and other findings (next steps) with rationale.
- Provided a concise summary and recommendations that synthesize key points and guide implementation.
- Used the stakeholder memorandum template to structure the communication.

## Folder Structure and Status
