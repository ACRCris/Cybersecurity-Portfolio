# Cybersecurity Audit – Botium Toys

## Summary

Conduct an internal audit of Botium Toys’ cybersecurity program. The audit aligns current business practices with industry standards and best practices. It provides mitigation recommendations for high‑risk vulnerabilities and proposes strategies to improve the organization’s security posture. The audit team documents findings, provides remediation plans and efforts, and communicates with stakeholders.

## Scope

The Botium Toys internal IT audit assesses:
- Current user permissions configured in the following systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, and the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Current controls implemented in those systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, and SIEM.
- Current procedures and protocols in place for those systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, and SIEM.
- Whether existing user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols align with applicable compliance requirements, and whether current technology (hardware and systems access) is properly accounted for.

## Objectives

The objectives for Botium Toys’ internal IT audit are to:
- Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).
- Establish better processes to ensure systems remain compliant.
- Strengthen system controls.
- Implement least‑privilege for user credential management; establish policies and procedures (including playbooks); and ensure compliance requirements are met.


# Risk Assessment

## Current assets

Assets managed by the IT department include:
- On‑premises equipment for office business needs.
- Workforce equipment: end‑user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- Systems, software, and services management: accounting, telecommunications, databases, security, e‑commerce, and inventory management.
- Internet access.
- Internal network.
- Vendor access management.
- Data‑center hosting services.
- Data retention and storage.
- ID card readers.
- Legacy systems maintenance: outdated systems that require human supervision.

## Risk description

There is currently insufficient asset management. In addition, Botium Toys has not implemented appropriate controls and may be out of compliance with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

## Recommended control practices

The first NIST CSF function is Identify. Botium Toys should allocate resources to manage assets and determine the impact that loss of existing assets (including systems) would have on business continuity.

## Risk score

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8 (high) due to the absence of key controls and gaps in regulatory and standards compliance.

## Additional notes
The potential impact from loss of an asset is rated Medium because the IT department lacks full visibility into which assets could be affected. The likelihood of asset loss or regulatory fines is High, given that Botium Toys has not implemented all necessary controls and is not fully compliant with required regulations and standards to maintain customer data privacy.


# Compliance checklist

- [x] **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Protects the processing of EU residents’ data and their right to privacy inside and outside EU territory.
- [x] **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**: International security standard that ensures organizations storing, processing, and transmitting credit‑card information do so in a secure environment.
- [x] **ISO/IEC 27001**: Internationally recognized standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS) to protect assets such as financial information, intellectual property, personnel data, and third‑party information.

## Explanation

- **GDPR**: Required because the company conducts business in the European Union and collects personal information from EU residents.
- **PCI DSS**: Required because the company stores, accepts, processes, and transmits credit‑card data online.
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Recommended to establish an ISMS that governs information security controls across the organization, including international operations and third‑party data handling.
