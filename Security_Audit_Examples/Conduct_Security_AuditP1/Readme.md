# Activity Summary 

Portfolio Activity: Conduct a Security Audit (Part 1) from the course "Manage Security Risks" in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

I performed an internal security audit for the fictitious company Botium Toys, a small U.S. toy maker with a single physical headquarters and a growing online presence. I reviewed the IT managerâ€™s audit scope, goals, and risk assessment; then, using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), I completed a controls assessment and a compliance checklist to evaluate risks, essential controls, and applicable regulations.

## Objectives accomplished

- Reviewed audit scope, objectives, and risk assessment provided by IT management.
- Identified major risks and mapped them to administrative, technical, and physical controls; prioritized immediate vs. future actions.
- Completed the compliance checklist and explained applicability of GDPR, PCI DSS, and ISO/IEC 27001; noted SOC 1/2 as future work.
- Summarized recommendations and captured results for portfolio use.
