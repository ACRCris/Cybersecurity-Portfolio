# Activity Summary 

Module 2 activity 1 of the course **Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate

In this activity I evaluated an expanding companyâ€™s authentication, authorization, and accounting practices after a near-miss financial incident. The work involved reviewing the access log, documenting observations that point to a potential threat actor, identifying control gaps, and recommending improvements to strengthen access controls.

## Objectives accomplished

- Reviewed the incident access log to understand the sequence of events.
- Noted suspicious behaviors and potential threat indicators tied to the incident.
- Identified weaknesses in existing authentication, authorization, and accounting controls.
- Recommended specific control improvements to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
