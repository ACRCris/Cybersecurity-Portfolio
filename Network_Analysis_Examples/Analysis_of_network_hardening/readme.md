# Activity Summary 

Module 4 activity 2 of the course **Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

I analyzed a fictitious scenario about a social‑media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. I identified common network‑hardening tools and methods, selected a key vulnerability, proposed hardening approaches to address it, and explained how the chosen controls reduce risk and help prevent future incidents.


## Objectives accomplished

- Identified 1–3 network‑hardening tools and methods applicable to the scenario.
- Selected a specific vulnerability (e.g., password sharing, default DB admin password, missing firewall rules, or lack of MFA) to address.
- Explained why the selected controls are effective and how often they should be applied.
- Produced a concise security risk assessment using the provided template and support materials.


## Folder Structure and Status

- SecurityRiskAssessmentReport.md: Security risk assessment deliverable that summarizes the scenario, selected vulnerability, recommended hardening controls, rationale, and application frequency.

- NetworkHardeningTools.pdf: Reference sheet of network‑hardening tools/methods to support control selection (e.g., port filtering, access privileges, encryption, MFA). Read‑only reference.
