# Activity Summary 

Module 4 activity 2 of the course **Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

In this activity requieres analyze a scenario about a social‑media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. You will identify common network‑hardening tools and methods, select one key vulnerability, propose hardening approaches to address it, and explain how the chosen controls reduce risk and help prevent future incidents.


## Objectives

- Identify 1–3 network‑hardening tools and methods applicable to the scenario.
- Select a specific vulnerability (e.g., password sharing, default DB admin password, missing firewall rules, or lack of MFA) to address.
- Explain why the selected controls are effective and how often they should be applied.
- Produce a concise security risk assessment using the provided template and support materials.


## Folder Structure and Status

- SecurityRiskAssessmentReport.md: Security risk assessment deliverable that summarizes the scenario, selected vulnerability, recommended hardening controls, rationale, and application frequency.
- Activity-Analysis-of-network-hardening_Security-risk-assessment-report.docx: Editable report template for completing the activity. Use this as a starting point if you prefer DOCX format.
- NetworkHardeningTools.pdf: Reference sheet of network‑hardening tools/methods to support control selection (e.g., port filtering, access privileges, encryption, MFA). Read‑only reference.
