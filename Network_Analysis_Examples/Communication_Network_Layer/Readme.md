# Activity Summary 

Module 3 activity 1 of the course **Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.

This activity involves analyzing a file that contains DNS traffic from the application layer and ICMP traffic from the internet layer in the TCP/IP model of a fictitious website "yummyrecipesforme.com", with the aim of identifying a possible denial of service (DoS) attack and determining the method used to carry out the attack.

## Objectives

- Analyze network traffic to identify unusual patterns.
- Determine which network protocol was affected during the incident.
- Describe the actions taken by the IT team to prevent further attacks


## Folder Structure and Status

- CiberSecurityIncidentReport.md: Report with analysis that includes:
    - Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log.
    - Analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident
    
- DNS_ICMPTrafficLog.pdf: Exported DNS and ICMP traffic log used for analysis; includes timestamped queries/responses and ICMP echo/reply events to support DoS identification. Read-only reference.
