# Activity Summary

Module 1 activity 1 of the course **Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities** of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate

I classified network‑connected assets for a small home‑office business environment. I created and updated an asset inventory spreadsheet; added three new devices beyond the starter sample; captured core characteristics (network access frequency, owner, and physical location); recorded concise risk‑relevant notes; and assigned a sensitivity level to each device to guide protection priorities.

## Objectives accomplished

- Added three additional home network devices not already listed (e.g., storage device, smart home sensor, streaming device).
- Documented Network Access, Owner, and Location for each new asset.
- Recorded 1–2 notes per device emphasizing confidentiality, integrity, or availability considerations.
- Assigned an appropriate sensitivity classification (e.g., Public / Internal / Confidential / Restricted) based on potential impact if compromised.
- Preserved a clean blank copy of the inventory template for future reuse and professional demonstration.

## Folder Structure and Status

- Home asset inventory.xlsx: Working spreadsheet with added devices, characteristics, notes, and sensitivity levels (plus retained blank template copy if duplicated).
